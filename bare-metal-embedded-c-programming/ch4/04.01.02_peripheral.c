/**
 * PERIPHERAL MEMORY
 * 
 * dedicated to managing and interfacing with the microcontroller's onboard peripherals
 * include timers, communication interfaces, and analog-to-digital converters
 * 
 * made up of registers that are used to configure and manage these peripherals
 * 
 * MICROCONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE
 * 
 * MEMORY-MAPPED INPUT/OUPUT
 * - TECHNIQUE WHERE PERIPHERAL REGISTERS ARE ASSIGNED SPECIFIC ADDRESSES IN THE SYSTEM'S MEMORY SPACE
 * ALLOWS FIRMWARE TO INTERACT WITH HARDWARE PERIPHERALS BY READING FROM OR WRITING TO THESE MEMORY ADDRESSES,
 * JUST AS IT WOULD WITH REGULAR MEMORY.
