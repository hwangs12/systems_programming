/**
 * Say we had a black box
 * takes two numbers as input 
 * and outputs their sum
 * say we have another doing multiplication
 * 
 * show how to calculate
 * 
 * ax + b
 * average of the four input w, x, y, z
 * a^2 + 2ab + b^2
 * 
 * Solution:
 * 
 * let's define addition box as A
 * multiplication box as M
 * 
 * (aMx)Ab
 * (((wAx)Ay)Az)M(0.25)
 * ((aMa)A((2Ma)Mb))A(bMb)
