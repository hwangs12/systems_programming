/**
 * Suppose we wish to put a set of names
 * in alphabetical order
 * We call the act of doing so sorting
 * One algorithm that can accomplish that
 * is called the bubble sort.
 * 
 * We could then program our buble
 * sort algorithm in C and compile the C program
 * to execute on an x86 ISA.
 * 
 * The x86 ISA can be implemented with
 * an Intel Pentium IV microarchitecture.
 * 
 * Let us call the sequence "Bubble Sort,
 * C program, x86 ISA, Pentium IV 
 * microarchitecture" one transformation
 * process
 * 
 * Assume we have available four sorting 
 * algorithms and can program in C, C++,
 * Pascal, Fortra, and COBOL. 
 * We have available compilers that can
 * translate from each of these
 * to either x86 or SPARC, and we
 * have available three different
 * microarchitectures for x86 and three
 * different microarchitectures for
 * SPARC.
 * 
 * How many transformation process are possible?
 * A. 120
 * 
 * Write three examples of transformation processes.
 * A. BUBBLE SORT, C, X86 ISA, PENTIUM IV
 * A. BUBBLE SORT, C++, SPARC ISA, Ultra machines
 * A. MERGE SORT, COBOL, X86 ISA, 
 * 
 * How many transformation processes are possible
 * if instead of three different microarchitectures
 * for x86 and three different microarchitectures for
 * SPARC, there were two for x86 and four for SPARC?
 * A. SAME
