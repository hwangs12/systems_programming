// Pointers are complex
// Understanding requires a working knowledge of the program stack and heap

// Approach
// if we allocate a struct whose logical size is 45, actually more than 45 bytes are typically allocated
// memory allocated may be fragmented

// Audience - book assumes minimal understanding of C

// INTRO

// POINTER is a variable that stores the address of a memory location
// :) the concept quickly becomes complicated when we start applying pointer operators
// and try to discern their cryptic notations (YES!)
